    content: Chris has redeveloped our website with fresh new ideas and provided us
      with several options to expand or create a more interactive website for our
      clients.  The cost in doing so was very reasonable and the process was very
      smooth.  Were happy with the end result and look forward to continually redeveloping
      our website with new innovative ideas.
