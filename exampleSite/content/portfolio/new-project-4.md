### Calgary Web Design & Studio Phi Tattoos

My good friend Dustin runs a tattoo shop in Calgary and asked me to help out with his square space site. The cool thing about square space is that I was able to pull the site locally (to my work computer) and work on the site in code. After building the hero image with photos already on the server I did some layout changes and helped implement Art of where API with Square space.

## The Project:

### The Build

* Custom HTML
* Custom CSS and SASS
* Custom JavaScript
* Google API's
* Square Space API

### Deployment

Deploy site and E commerce to squarepsace
